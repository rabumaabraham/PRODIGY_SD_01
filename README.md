# Temperature Converter Application

This is a simple and interactive Temperature Converter Application built using Python and Tkinter. Developed during my software development internship at Prodigy Infotech, this application allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. By entering a temperature and selecting the original unit of measurement, users can see the converted temperature values in the other two units. The GUI is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface using Tkinter.
